# Script-Based Workflow for Catalog Operations

For catalog operations that need to be reproducible, auditable, or shareable — dataset creation, splitting, ETL, feature creation, and data loading — use a committed script rather than interactive MCP tools.

## When to Use Scripts vs Interactive MCP

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| One-off exploration, quick queries, checking state | Interactive MCP tools |
| Setting descriptions, display names, annotations | Interactive MCP tools |
| Operations you'll need to reproduce or share | Committed script |
| Dataset creation, splitting, ETL, data loading | Committed script |
| Operations others need to audit or re-run | Committed script |

The key distinction: DerivaML records the git commit hash with every execution. A committed script gives the execution record a code reference that anyone can trace back. Interactive MCP operations have no such reference.

## Workflow: Develop, Test, Commit, Run

1. **Generate** a Python script in the `scripts/` directory using the DerivaML Python API. Use the base script template and common patterns from `references/script-patterns.md`.
2. **Test** with `--dry-run` to verify correctness without creating catalog records.
3. **Commit** the script so the git commit hash in the execution record points to the actual code.
4. **Run** for real. The execution record captures git commit hash, repository URL, input datasets and versions, output assets and datasets, and execution parameters.

For detailed script templates (base template, dataset creation, splitting, feature population, ETL), see [Script Pattern Templates](references/script-patterns.md).

## When MCP Tools Are Still Appropriate

Not everything needs a script. Use MCP tools directly for:

- **Exploratory work**: Browsing catalog structure, querying data, checking entity states
- **One-time admin tasks**: Setting descriptions, display names, annotations
- **Read-only operations**: Listing datasets, viewing features, checking versions
- **Quick debugging**: Inspecting specific records, checking execution status

## When to Suggest Scripts

When a user asks to perform a data-modifying operation interactively, suggest:

> "For full provenance tracking, I recommend creating a script that we can commit. This ensures the operation is reproducible and the execution record will reference the exact code. Shall I generate the script?"

Then follow the Develop, Test, Commit, Run workflow.
