# Check and Update DerivaML Ecosystem

Check whether the user's DerivaML components are up to date, then offer to update each outdated component.

This skill covers the **tier-2** surface — the DerivaML-specific components that build on top of the core Deriva ecosystem. It assumes the tier-1 surface (`deriva-py`, `deriva-mcp-core`, `deriva` plugin) has already been checked via `/deriva:check-deriva-versions`. **Run that skill first**; if its components are outdated, update them before checking the ML layer (deriva-ml depends on deriva-py; deriva-ml-mcp depends on deriva-mcp-core).

**Important:** Skills (including this one) are a Claude Code feature. Claude Desktop does not have plugins or skills — it only has MCP servers. If running in Claude Desktop, you can only check the MCP server (deriva-ml-mcp) version.

## Components to Check

| Component | What | How to check | Who can update |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------------|
| **deriva-ml** | Python library in the project's `.venv` (DerivaML domain library) | Script (needs project venv) | Claude (automated) |
| **deriva-ml-skills** | The `deriva-ml` Claude Code plugin (this plugin) | Script (reads plugin cache) | Automated (cache refresh + restart) |
| **deriva-ml-mcp** | DerivaML MCP plugin loaded by deriva-mcp-core | `deriva://server/version` resource (look for `deriva-ml-mcp` plugin entry) | User (restart required) |

> **Note:** This skill currently invokes the shared `check_versions.py` script that lives at `../check-deriva-versions/scripts/check_versions.py` in the deriva-skills repo (legacy from before the tier-1 / tier-2 split). It will get its own dedicated script when this skill physically moves to the `deriva-ml-skills` repo during Phase 3 of the restructure (and that script gets a Phase 4 sweep to align with the deriva-ml-mcp v1.4 surface). Until the split, the `--component` flag is the boundary — invoke only with the components listed in this skill's table above.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Run the tier-1 check first

If you have not already run `/deriva:check-deriva-versions` in this session, do so now. The DerivaML stack depends on the core Deriva stack — it makes no sense to update `deriva-ml` while `deriva-py` is stale.

If the user explicitly asks for ML-only checks, you may skip this — but mention the dependency.

### Step 1: Check deriva-ml version

The script must run in the **project's Python environment**. Follow this sequence:

1. **Check if CWD has a `pyproject.toml`** — if yes, run from here:
   ```bash
   uv run python3 ../check-deriva-versions/scripts/check_versions.py --component deriva-ml --json
   ```
   (Path is relative to this skill's directory; use the absolute path if running from elsewhere.)

2. **If no `pyproject.toml` in CWD**, ask the user:
   > "I need to check the `deriva-ml` version in your project's virtual environment. What directory is your DerivaML project in?"

   Then `cd` to that directory and run with `uv run python3`.

3. **If the user has no local project** (MCP-only workflow), skip this component — they don't have a local `deriva-ml` install to check.

### Step 2: Check deriva-ml-skills plugin version

```bash
python3 ../check-deriva-versions/scripts/check_versions.py --component skills --json
```

This reads the plugin cache and compares against the latest GitHub release tag.

> **Note:** Until Phase 3 of the restructure ships, this `--component skills` flag in the legacy script reports the `deriva-skills` plugin (which is in transition between tier-1 and tier-2). After Phase 3, the new dedicated script in `deriva-ml-skills` will report on the `deriva-ml-skills` plugin specifically.

**Skip this in Claude Desktop** — Desktop doesn't have plugins.

### Step 3: Check deriva-ml-mcp plugin version

Read the `deriva://server/version` resource. The response includes the running deriva-mcp-core framework version plus a list of loaded plugins; look for the `deriva-ml-mcp` entry.

If the resource read fails (MCP server not running), report as "UNKNOWN — MCP server not running". If the resource succeeds but no `deriva-ml-mcp` entry appears, report as "NOT LOADED — deriva-ml-mcp plugin not active in this server".

Compare the returned plugin version against the latest release tag for `informatics-isi-edu/deriva-mcp` (legacy repo name; the script knows this).

### Step 4: Present results

Show a summary table:

| Component | Status | Installed | Latest |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| deriva-ml | UP TO DATE | 1.25.1 | v1.25.1 |
| deriva-ml-skills | OUTDATED | 0.12.1 | v0.12.2 |
| deriva-ml-mcp | UP TO DATE | 1.4.0 | v1.4.0 |

If everything is up to date, say so and stop. Otherwise, proceed to Step 5.

### Step 5: Offer updates for outdated components

#### deriva-ml (automated)

```bash
uv run python3 ../check-deriva-versions/scripts/check_versions.py --component deriva-ml --update
```

This runs `uv lock --upgrade-package deriva-ml && uv sync` and verifies the new version.

#### deriva-ml-skills (Claude Code only)

Run the update script, which refreshes the local marketplace cache:
```bash
python3 ../check-deriva-versions/scripts/check_versions.py --component skills --update
```

The script checks whether `autoUpdate` is enabled in `~/.claude/settings.json` and adjusts its advice (same logic as the tier-1 sibling).

#### deriva-ml-mcp (user action — restart required)

The MCP server cannot be updated by Claude because restarting it breaks the MCP connection mid-session. Tell the user how to update based on their deployment:

- **Docker** (most common): `docker pull ghcr.io/informatics-isi-edu/deriva-mcp:latest && docker restart deriva-mcp` (the container ships both core and ml-mcp; updating the image updates both)
- **Native install**: `cd <project-dir> && uv lock --upgrade-package deriva-ml-mcp && uv sync`, then restart the server

### Step 6: Confirm

After updates, re-run the relevant checks to confirm everything is current.

## Status Values

- **UP TO DATE** — No action needed
- **OUTDATED** — Newer version available; offer to update
- **UPDATED** — Successfully updated (shown after `--update`)
- **UNKNOWN** — Could not determine status (not installed, server not running, network issue)
- **NOT LOADED** — Component is installed but the MCP plugin is not active in the running server
- **Dev version** — Installed from git HEAD, at or ahead of latest release. Normal for developers working on the library itself.

- **`/deriva:check-deriva-versions`** *(tier-1)* — Run this first to verify the foundational Deriva ecosystem (deriva-py, deriva-mcp-core, deriva plugin) is current before checking the ML layer.
