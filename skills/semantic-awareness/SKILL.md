> **Note (2026-03-16):** The Deriva MCP server now performs automatic duplicate detection (Layer 3) on all creation tools (`create_table`, `create_asset_table`, `create_vocabulary`, `create_feature`). When a near-duplicate entity is detected, the tool response includes a `similar_existing` field with suggestions and a warning message. This skill remains available as a behavioral guardrail for users on older MCP server versions that lack built-in duplicate detection.

# Catalog Semantic Awareness — Find Before You Create

Before creating ANY new catalog entity (table, vocabulary term, feature, dataset, workflow), search for existing entities that serve the same or similar purpose. Duplicate entities fragment data, confuse users, and undermine the catalog as a single source of truth.

This skill also applies when looking up any entity by name — catalog entities are created by different people at different times, so the same concept often appears under different names, spellings, or structures.

## Why This Matters

Deriva catalogs are shared, long-lived systems. When someone creates a "Diagnosis" feature without noticing that "Disease_Classification" already exists on the same table, data gets split, queries become ambiguous, and downstream consumers don't know which to use. A two-minute search before creation prevents hours of cleanup later.

## The Process

### 1. Parse Semantic Intent

Understand what the user actually needs — not just the literal name, but the underlying concept. "I need a table for patient demographics" might match an existing "Subject" table. "Add a quality label" might match an existing "Image_Quality" feature.

### 2. Expand the Search Term

Before querying, expand the user's term into a set of candidates:

- **Synonyms**: "Patient" → also search "Subject", "Participant", "Individual"
- **Abbreviations**: "DR" → also search "Diabetic_Retinopathy"
- **Spelling variants**: "Xray" → also search "X-ray", "X_ray", "X-Ray"
- **Misspellings**: "Diagnossis" → also search "Diagnosis"; "fundus" → "Fundus"
- **Singular/plural**: "Image" → also search "Images"
- **Formatting variants**: underscores vs spaces vs camelCase, capitalization differences

### 3. Query the Catalog

Use MCP resources to retrieve candidates. Which resources depend on the entity type:

**Tables:**
```
deriva://catalog/schema                       # All tables with columns and descriptions
deriva://table/{table_name}/schema            # Specific table details
```

**Vocabulary terms:**
```
deriva://vocabulary/{vocab_name}              # All terms with descriptions and synonyms
deriva://vocabulary/{vocab_name}/{term_name}  # Lookup by name or synonym
```

**Features:**
```
deriva://table/{table_name}/features          # Features on a target table
deriva://feature/{table_name}/{feature_name}  # Feature details
deriva://catalog/features                     # All features across all tables
```

**Datasets:**
```
deriva://catalog/datasets    # All datasets with types and descriptions
deriva://dataset/<rid>       # Specific dataset details
```

**Workflows:**
```
deriva://catalog/workflows   # All workflows with descriptions
```

For queries that need actual data (counts, specific records, filtering), use the `query_table` or `count_table` MCP tools.

### 4. Score Closeness Across Multiple Signals

For each candidate entity, assess how close it is to what the user is looking for. No single signal is sufficient — weigh them together:

| Signal | What to check | Strong match indicator |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Name** | Edit distance, synonym match, abbreviation expansion, misspelling tolerance | Edit distance ≤ 2, or known synonym |
| **Description** | Keyword overlap, stated purpose, domain context | 3+ shared domain keywords |
| **Values/Contents** | For vocabs: term overlap. For tables: column overlap. For datasets: member overlap | 50%+ overlap in values or 3+ matching columns |
| **Relationships** | FK count, features referencing it, datasets containing it, record count | Entity with many relationships is well-established |
| **Structure** | Column types, vocabulary references, FK targets | Structural alignment suggests same purpose |

**Thresholds:**
- Match on **1 signal**: Mention as a possibility, low confidence
- Match on **2+ signals**: Present as a likely match
- Match on **name + description + data/relationships**: Almost certainly the same entity

### 5. Decide: Reuse, Extend, or Create

Based on the candidates found, recommend one of these actions. The right action depends on the entity type and what gap exists:

**Tables:**
- Table exists and fully matches → **Reuse as-is**
- Table exists but missing columns → **Add columns** (`add_column`)
- Table exists but missing a relationship → **Add a foreign key**
- No match → **Create new** with a good description

**Vocabulary terms:**
- Term exists under different spelling → **Add a synonym** (`add_synonym`)
- Vocabulary exists but term is missing → **Add the term** (`add_term`)
- Term exists in a different vocabulary → **Point user to the correct vocabulary**
- No match → **Create new term** with a good description

**Features:**
- Feature exists on same table, same purpose → **Reuse the existing feature**
- Feature exists but its vocabulary needs new terms → **Add terms** to the vocabulary (`add_term`)
- Feature exists on a different table → **Clarify intent** — may need a new one or may be targeting wrong table
- No match → **Create new** with a good description

**Datasets:**
- Dataset exists and matches → **Reuse**, possibly with a new version
- Dataset exists but needs more members → **Add members** (`add_dataset_members`)
- Dataset exists but needs a different split → **Split the existing dataset** (`split_dataset`)
- No match → **Create new** with a good description

**Workflows:**
- Workflow exists with same purpose → **Reuse** with different execution parameters
- No match → **Create new** with a good description

### 6. Present Matches with Evidence

When you find close matches, present them with the evidence AND a specific recommended action:

```markdown
I found existing entities that may match what you need:

### "Subject" table (RID: 1-ABC)
- **Description**: "Research participants enrolled in the study"
- **Matching columns**: Name, Age, Gender (3 of 4 requested columns match)
- **Relationships**: 5 FK references from other tables, 2 features, 450 records
- **Gap**: Missing "Enrollment_Date" column

**Recommended action**: Add an "Enrollment_Date" column to the existing Subject table
rather than creating a duplicate "Patient" table. This preserves all existing
relationships and data.
```

Let the user decide. Never create without presenting findings first.

### 7. Create with a Good Description

If no match exists, create the new entity with a clear, searchable description. Future searches depend on descriptions being informative — a vague description like "data" or "labels" makes the entity invisible.

See the `generate-descriptions` skill for templates and detailed guidance.

## Entity-Specific Gotchas

**Tables**: "Subject" vs "Patient" vs "Participant" — these are often the same concept. Check column structure and record count, not just names. A table with 500 records and 5 FK relationships is worth extending, not duplicating.

**Vocabulary terms**: Always search synonyms. "X-ray" might have synonym "Xray" or "radiograph". The right action is usually `add_synonym`, not `add_term`. Use the `deriva://vocabulary/{vocab_name}/{term_name}` resource which matches against synonyms automatically.

**Features**: A feature named "Quality" and one named "Image_Quality" on the same table are almost certainly duplicates. The combination of target table + vocabulary is the strongest duplicate signal. Check how many values already exist — a feature with thousands of values is definitely established.

**Datasets**: Before creating a new training dataset, check member counts on existing datasets. An existing complete dataset with 10,000 members can be split rather than built from scratch. Check children/parents — the needed dataset may already exist as a split.

**Workflows**: Before creating "ResNet Training v2", check if "ResNet Training" already exists — you might just need different execution parameters. Check description and type.

## The Flow

```
User requests creation or lookup
  → Parse semantic intent (what do they actually need?)
  → Expand search terms (synonyms, abbreviations, misspellings)
  → Query catalog resources for candidates
  → Score closeness across multiple signals
  → Assess: reuse, extend, or create?
  → Present matches with evidence and recommended action
  → User decides
  → Execute the chosen action (with good description if creating new)
```
